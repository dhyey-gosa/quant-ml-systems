# Quantitative ML Systems

This repository contains quantitative machine learning systems focused on financial and time-series domains.

## What This Repo Demonstrates
- Time-series specific validation methodologies
- Regime detection and structural analysis
- Signal decay and stability analysis
- Transaction cost and slippage modeling
- Walk-forward and realistic backtesting

## Included Projects
- market-regime-detection-system  
- signal-evaluation-and-decay-framework  
- cost-aware-backtesting-engine  

## Key Constraints Addressed
- Non-stationarity
- Lookahead bias
- Execution realism
- Risk-adjusted evaluation

## How to Navigate
Each project is a standalone quantitative ML system.
Strong emphasis is placed on correctness and realism.
